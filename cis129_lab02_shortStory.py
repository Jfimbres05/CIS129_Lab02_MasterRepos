# Prints a simple short story about Bob.

print("There once was a Python Pogrammer named Bob.")

print("One day, Bob was writing his code on Github. He was developing the backend of a marketing website.")

print("Bob had made some BIG changes to the code, and committed all his changes to the main branch without testing.")

print("Turns out, there was a major bug within the new changes. Bob pushed his changes therefore the entire Main Branch was affected, since Bob didn't commit his changes in a new branch, he doesn't know where to find the effected area")

print("Eventually, the bug is fixed by helpful contributors, and the project is saved! Bob will never commit changes on the Main Branch again.")
